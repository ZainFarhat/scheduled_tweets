1.  Routes and Route Types

refer to this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwL_KWtflN0&list=PLm8ctt9NhMNV75T9WYIrA6m9I_uw7vS56&index=5

config -> routes.rb is where we define our routes for the application

we will configure the route to our about page here

get "about" is a command that will respond to a get request to the about url
to "about#index" will point it to a controller, in this case the about controller with an index action  

then we go to app -> controllers
inside we define a file named about_controller.rb

the to "about#index" command will look for a file named about_controller
naming convention is important, the genral way for get to routing is this
get "<page_name>", to "<page_name>#index"
then in app -> controllers we create a <page_name>_controller.rb

in the about_controller.rb we will create a ruby class, it takes the following syntax
class AboutController < ApplicationController

the class naming convention is PageNameController, where the page name is capitalized and Controller is capitalized as well
it should match the <page_name>_controller.rb name but with capitalized letters

our class inherits from the Application Controller class to get all of the functionality from rails

inside of out class we want to define our action


class AboutController < ApplicationController

    def index  
    end

end

index method does not need to do anything at all, that is because we are inheriting from the Application Controller

when it runs it will not do anything, but rails will look for app -> views -> about -> index.html.erb because for views we are asking for an html format and we are in the about index
so we create the about folder and html file ourselves (this is the rendering part)
the erb part of the file name allows us to write ruby syntax inside the html file using this erb syntax <%= %>

now if we go to localhost:3000/about, we will view the content of the index.html.erb file

we have a wrapper around this file called the layout, this is a folder called layout with three html.erb files, and this is going to define all of our style sheets , javascript, etc.

2. Root Route

we need to set the root route

in the routes.rb file we add another get to command
get "/", to:"main#index", the / is optional
however, since root is a special thing we can replace this with
root to:"main#index" 
as before we add a file app -> controllers -> main_controller.rb
then we go to app folder and create app -> views -> main -> index.html.erb
now the main page localhost:3000 will show the contents of the index.html.erb in the app -> views -> main folder
