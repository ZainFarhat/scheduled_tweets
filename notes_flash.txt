1. Flash Messages

in our main_controller.rb, specifically the index method, we will add
    flash.now[:notice] = "logged in successfully"
    flash.now[:alert] = "Invalid email or password"

flash is a hash object, it sends messages to the user based on condition (success or failure)
this is inherited from ApplicationController, a feature of rails controllers and views
the .now method is used to only display at current request

these are assigned in the controller, but to view them we need to print them out in the html files, specifically app -> views -> layout -> application.html.erb
because flash messages are shared across entire application

this is contained as a partial in a container as follows

<div class="container">
    <%= render partial: "shared/flash" %>
<%= yield %>

we will add a flash partial in shared folder, app -> views -> shared -> _flash.html.erb
inside this we will add html ruby code as follows

<%= flash[:notice] %>
<%= flash[:alert] %>

this will print out the contents of our flash messages

this is a basic example of a flash message

if we want to color code them we can add bootstrap code as follows

<% if flash[:notice] %>
    <div class="alert  alert-info mt-4" role = "alert">
        <%= flash[:notice] %>
    </div>
<% end %>
<% if flash[:alert] %>
    <div class="alert  alert-warning mt-4" role = "alert">
        <%= flash[:alert] %>
    </div>
<% end %>

Note:

<%=  %> is used when we want to print out the contents of the ruby code to views
<% %> is used when we do not want to print out the contents of ruby code to views
